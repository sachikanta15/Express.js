what is params?
these are query which are passed to the url and further we can use them in our code

to acess the query params we can use req.query

to pass in the url we can use ? and then the query name and value pair for multiple query we can use & to seperate them 
for example http://localhost:3000/person?name=shubham&age=20 after ? we have name and age as query and their value is shubham and 20 respectively and if we 
do console.log(req.query) we will get { name: 'shubham', age: '20' } as output

we can also store single keyword from the query that is name in this case in a variable by using req.query.name and we will get shubham as output
